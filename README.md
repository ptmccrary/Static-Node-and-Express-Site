# Static Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website created with Node.js and Express. It includes basic components of a portfolio website, such as: a home page showing the projects I've worked on, an about page to tell the viewer a little more about me, and a detailed project page for each project in my github library.

All the data about the projects is stored in a data.json file

Usage of Node.js and Express to:
- Import required dependencies
- Link the JSON with the pug templates
- Set up routes to handle requests
- Set up middleware to utilize static files like CSS
- Handle errors
- Set up a server to serve the project

## Usage
